ATUC128L5 is a customized version of UC128L4U, maybe different package.

So UC128L4U datasheet is analyzed instead due to no L5U datasheet available.

CPU: 32-bit AVR single-cycle RISC, MIPS instruction set
Clock frequency: • Up to 64DMIPS Running at 50MHz from Flash (1 Flash Wait State)
				 • Up to 36DMIPS Running at 25MHz from Flash (0 Flash Wait State)

Cache size: No caches implemented!
Flash Memory: 25Mhz SPI flash, 128KB
SRAM: 32KB
Interface: TWI and SPI
Oscillator: 32Khz
GPIO pins: 51
Power supply: 1.62-3.6v
